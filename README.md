# Make-A-Meal
<br>
We are a team of 3 ladies: Priya Sabaina & Sabrina. During the project our team have implemented agile development methodologies to help us work collaboratively.

<br>
In this project we have conceived and executed a design that solves the problem of finding a good recipe for your meal by using html, CSS and Javascript along with integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. This front-end application uses Bootstrap and two server-side APIs Links to an external site. The first one provides access to different recipes and youtube tutorial videos. And the second one translates the webpage into any languages that the user selects, its translation engine is powered by the open source Argos Translate library.

<br>
The WebApp use client-side storage to store persistent data. It is deployed to GitHub Pages, at the same time being responsive and interactive, which means it accept and respond to user input. It has two interfaces. The initial interface allows you to type in keywords and explore different meal options. Sequencially when the pictures of the meals are clicked the user would be redirected to the second interface with detailed recipe in english, a translation in French is also available.
